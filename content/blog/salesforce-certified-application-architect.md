I had been working hard and eagerly waiting for this day. Today, I passed the last requirement &#8212; Sharing & Visibility Designer certification to get my Salesforce Certified Application Architect certification.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Here are some of the resources I referenced,

* Sharing & Visibility [Trailmix](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/strailhead/trailmixes/architect-sharing-and-visibility) from Trailhead.
* Sharing & Visibility %md<a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/strailhead/trailmixes/architect-sharing-and-visibility">Trailmix</a> from Trailhead.

Watched YouTube videos of,  
* [Ladies Be Artchitects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsq0h5CE_bsViuAkKUFgc8FiwGMyY77i2)
* [Decode SFCertifications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwoI9BfZljs)

[Focus on Force](https://focusonforce.com/salesforce-certifications/sharing-visibility-designer/) &#8211; I used both the study guide & the practice exam. The practice exam helped a lot in the final review. The reasoning for the answers and reference links were very helpful. 

While using the above resources, I put together my own random notes for final review and it was handy in the last couple of days to brush up.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

With these certifications I&#8217;ve earned so far, I think the knowledge one gains from the work experience plays a key role. It definitely helped me a lot. 

So, my next stop? Salesforce Certified Integration Architecture Designer to climb the other side of the #journeyToCTA pyramid.<figure class="wp-block-image">

And, finally, a big thank you to all that are helping in this journey, especially to my family for being on my side during my preparation.
